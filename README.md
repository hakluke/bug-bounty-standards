# Bug Bounty Standards
A list of edge cases that occur in bug bounty programs, conversations on how they should be handled. The goal is to standardise the way that specific situations are handled in bug bounties.

| Situation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Hacker submits vulnerability with proof of exploitation. The vulnerability is fixed before the submission is triaged.                                                                                                                                                                | Platform must provide proof that the submission was not accessed by the program prior to resolution. If the submission was accessed by the program, the program should pay the relevant bounty, otherwise submission is marked as duplicate.                                                |
| Hacker submits vulnerability, program responds saying that they already knew about it internally.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Program must provide proof that this was a previously known issue, for example, a screenshot of a Jira ticket including the date created. If the program is unable to provide proof, they should pay the bounty, otherwise the submission should be marked as a duplicate.                  |
| Hacker submits vulnerability, it is marked as a duplicate of another submission that did not fully explore the impact of the bug. For example, a hacker submits a full XSS which allows an account takeover, and dupes against another submission that only reported HTML injection. | The first reporter receives a bounty based on the impact of their submission, the second reporter receives a bounty based on the impact of their submission minus the bounty received by the first reporter.                                                                                |
| Hacker submits vulnerability, the program never responds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Platform pays the bounty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Hacker submits vulnerability, hacker is incorrectly duped against a newer report.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Platform changes the status of both reports to be accurate. If payment has already been made incorrectly, the organization who triaged incorrectly pays the bounty. For managed bounty programs this would generally be the platform, but for unmanaged programs this would be the program. |
| Hacker disagrees on the assigned severity rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Hacker submits reasoning to ticket. If there is no response for 14 days, hacker submits reasoning to the platform's support channel. Severity upgrades are decided on a per-submission basis.                                                                                               |
| Hacker publicly discloses a bug that has been previously submitted to the platform, without explicit permission from the program owner.                                                                                                                                              | Hacker receives 30 day ban from platform, hacker is emailed with full reasoning behind ban. Repeat offence results in permanent ban.                                                                                                                                                        |
